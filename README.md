Marketing Funnel & Conversion Performance Analysis
By Future Interns

About the Project

This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Task 3 (2026). The objective of this task is to analyze marketing and lead funnel data to understand how users move from visitors to leads to customers, identify drop-off points, and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion rates.

Improving conversions is critical for startups, digital marketing agencies, SaaS companies, and sales teams, as it directly impacts revenue and growth.

Business Questions Addressed

This analysis focuses on answering key business questions such as where users are dropping off in the funnel, which channels bring high-quality leads, how conversion rates can be improved, and which funnel stages need optimization.

Tools Used

Power BI – for building interactive dashboards and visualizing funnel performance

Dataset

The dataset used represents a real-world marketing funnel scenario and includes information on website traffic, leads, campaigns, and conversions. The data was cleaned and structured to ensure accurate analysis of funnel stages, drop-offs, and channel performance.

What Was Done

The raw funnel data was first cleaned and organized to handle missing values and ensure consistency. Traffic, leads, and customer conversions were tracked across each stage of the funnel.

Conversion rates were calculated for each stage, and drop-off points were identified. The performance of different channels, campaigns, and time periods was compared to find high-performing sources and areas requiring improvement.

Visualizations were created to make insights clear and actionable, highlighting trends, drop-offs, and opportunities to improve overall conversion rates.

Insights & Findings

The analysis revealed where users drop off most frequently, which channels deliver the highest-quality leads, and which stages of the funnel require optimization. Patterns in conversion rates and user behavior were identified, offering clear guidance for improving marketing effectiveness.

Business Recommendations

Based on the findings, the business should focus on optimizing high drop-off stages, investing in high-performing channels, and implementing targeted strategies to improve lead-to-customer conversions. Continuous monitoring of funnel metrics and experimentation with campaign strategies is recommended to increase overall conversion rates.
